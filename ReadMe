README File

Use:
    This package and the GUI are used to visualize dynamic images, segment them and extract parameters. 
    It was created for the sake of working with Dynamic Nuclear Medicine images.
    It might thus work with other types of images, but will probably not be optimized.

Note:
    The GUI and the code is functional on a MacBookPro computer. 
    It has not yet been tested with another OS.

Packages Required:
    -Numpy          --For all computations
    -Scipy          --To compute the parameters
    -SkImage        --For filters and Canny edge detection algorithm
    -Time           --To track the time elapsed for processes
    -Numba          --To increase the speed of some functions
    -Dynesty        --To compute the parameters
    -os             --To clear the screen (easily circumvented)
    -matplotlib     --To create the images and graphs
    -pydicom        --To extract the images
    -pickle         --To save and load data

GUI:
    The GUI is the easy way to work with the code.
    Opening a File:
        A path can be input or browsed at the top left of the screen to locate the dicom files.
        By clicking "Extract", the dicom files will be opened and put together to form a 4-D volume.
        Otherwise,
